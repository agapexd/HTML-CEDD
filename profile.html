				<p> 	Who am I? I am Romeo Cedric C. Susaya III (Ced),
					and here are some infos about me. I enjoy engaging in activities
					that can advance several facets of my life, like pushing myself academically 
					to get better grades and exercising to get in shape and healthy. I really enjoy 
					listening to music because it is so amazing and making me feel less anxious.
				</p>
				
				<p>		I have other interests like editing, playing video games, and going to gym.	
					When the lockdown occured, I started to watch several tutorials and learn how to 
					edit videos because I was bored at that time. I also started playing video games 
					when lockdown happened to avoid the feeling of loneliness and sadness. Recently 
					I loved going to the gym because I've met some cool and nice people there. Additionally,
					going to gym has numerous advantages, such as helping me avoid playing computer games, 
					break bad habits and, to be fit and healthy.
				</p>
				
				<p> 	And here are some other infos about me, I'm a 10th grade student in
					Bulacan State University (BulSU). I currently live in Guiguinto, Bulacan
					My mother's name is Christina C. Susaya and my father's name is Romeo M. Susaya Jr,
					We love to explore things as an family.
